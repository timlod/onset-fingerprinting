This repository is concerned with developing novel ways to computationally work
with musical, especially percussive, sound onsets.

Currently several items are developed concurrently:
- Percussive Onset Sound Dataset specification (POSD)
  - an open dataset specification to methodically work with audio onset data
  - see [[file:notebooks/dataset_spec_draft.org]]
- Multilateration algorithms to locate where sounds were generated based on
  multiple sensors
  - e.g. when striking a drumhead, use several sensors to get precise
    coordinates of where the strike landed
- Onset fingerprinting/classification algorithms
  - given a percussive onset, classify it as being a specific sound, under
    real-time constraints
  - used for example to electronically augment live playing
